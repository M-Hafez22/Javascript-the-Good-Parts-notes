# Style

> We should obviously avoid JavaScript’s worst features. Surprisingly, perhaps, *we should also avoid the features that are often useful but occasionally hazardous*.

- The long-term value of software to an organization is in direct proportion to the quality of the codebase. Over its lifetime, a program will be handled by many pairs of hands and eyes. If a program is able to **clearly communicate its structure and characteristics**, it is less likely to break when it is modified in the never-too distant future.

> Style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. **It makes for better reading**.

> Make the structure of your programs self-illuminating, eliminating the need for comments.

- JavaScript allows variables to be declared after they are used.
That feels like a mistake to me.
- Use whitespace to make it more readable.
- Put at most one statement on a line.
- If a statement doesn’t fit on a line, I will break it after a *comma* or a *binary operator*.
- Declare all variables at the beginning of each function.
- Use line comments `//comment` in the code
- Use block commenting `/* */` for decuminting the code Or [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
