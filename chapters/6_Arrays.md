# Chapter 6 - Arrays

- JavaScript does not have a real array. instead, **it provides an object that has some array-like characteristics**.

- It converts array subscripts into strings that are used to make properties. It is significantly slower than a real array.

- Arrays have their own literal format and their own set of methods (Chapter 8 - Methods).
