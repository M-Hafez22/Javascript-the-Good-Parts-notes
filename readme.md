## Chapter 1 - Good Parts

- Why JavaScript?
    - The reasons that make it a despised programming language for some Developers are:
        - the  poorly specified and inconsistently implemented in the *DOM*.
        - Some developers - who forced to work with JS - *didn't put effort to learn the differences*.

- Analyzing JavaScript
    - JavaScript is built on some very good ideas and a few very bad ones.
        - <span style="color:green">The very good ideas</span> include
            - <span style="color:orange">functions</span> : JavaScript’s functions are first class objects with (mostly) lexical scoping.
            - <span style="color:orange">loose typing</span>
            - <span style="color:orange">dynamic objects</span>:  JavaScript has a very powerful object literal notation. Objects can be created simply by listing their components. This notation was the inspiration for JSON
            - <span style="color:orange">JavaScript is prototypal inheritance</span>.  ( objects inherit properties directly from other objects ) But you have to learn to work with JavaScript’s prototypal nature.

        - <span style="color:red">The bad ideas</span> include a programming model based on global variables.
            - <span style="color:orange">global variables</span>: All of the top-level variables of all compilation units are tossed together in a common namespace called the global object.


        > JavaScript is lightweight and expressive.
